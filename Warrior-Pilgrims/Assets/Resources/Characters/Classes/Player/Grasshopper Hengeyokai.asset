  _description: "DPS/Support: Joy-in-Thunder is fast and deals good damage to single
    targets, even those that might be hard to hit. However, his attacks tend to have
    fewer riders than other characters\u2019, and he is reliant upon his evasion
    and movement to stay out of harm\u2019s way. Players must plan ahead to ensure
    that his movement does not disrupt the team\u2019s formation, or he may become
    a liability."
