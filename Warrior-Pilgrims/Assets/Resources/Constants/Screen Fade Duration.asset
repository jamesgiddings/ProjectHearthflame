  DeveloperDescription: A Scriptable Object that holds the value for the duration
    of the screen fade in seconds, so it can be plugged into objects that need it.
    This doesn't actually change the value, it just provides a reference. To change
    the value, alter the endpoint in the animation itself.
  Value: 1
